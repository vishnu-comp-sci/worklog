Implement Real-time Heart Rate Monitoring System

Ticket Description:
This ticket involves developing a real-time monitoring system to capture and display heart rate data from a Bluetooth peripheral that supports the Heart Rate Service (HRS). The system will scan for and connect to the specified Bluetooth device, subscribe to notifications for the heart rate characteristic, and continuously display the received data.

Steps to Implement:

Bluetooth Interface Setup:

Enable the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) interface to initiate device discovery and connection.
Device Discovery and Connection:

Implement device scanning functionality to discover the Bluetooth peripheral broadcasting heart rate data.
Connect to the identified peripheral once it's found.
Service and Characteristic Discovery:

Discover the Heart Rate Service (HRS) and its associated characteristics on the connected device.
Notification Subscription:

Subscribe to notifications for the Heart Rate Measurement characteristic to receive real-time heart rate data updates.
Data Processing and Display:

Process the received heart rate data and display it in real-time.
Ensure proper handling of the variable-length structure of the Heart Rate Measurement characteristic.
Testing Approach:

Conduct comprehensive testing to ensure the system effectively scans, connects to the Bluetooth peripheral, and receives and displays heart rate data accurately.
Verify compatibility with various Bluetooth peripherals supporting the Heart Rate Service.
Test error handling mechanisms to address potential connection failures or data retrieval issues.
Additional Considerations:

Provide clear logging and error messages to facilitate troubleshooting and debugging.
Document any dependencies or assumptions made during the implementation process.
Ensure compatibility with both desktop systems and microcontroller boards, as outlined in the usage instructions.
