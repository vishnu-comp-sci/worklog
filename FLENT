Install Flent: First, ensure that Flent is installed on your testing machine. Flent can be installed from the official Flent repository or via package managers like pip.

Configure SQM on OpenWRT: Set up SQM on your OpenWRT router. SQM is typically used to manage and control network traffic to prevent bufferbloat and improve overall network performance. Configure SQM according to your network's requirements, specifying parameters such as bandwidth, queue discipline (e.g., Cake, fq_codel), and link layer adaptation.

Prepare Test Environment: Ensure that your testing environment is set up correctly. This includes connecting your testing machine to the OpenWRT router and ensuring that the router is configured to route traffic through the SQM instance.

Run Flent Tests: Use Flent to conduct network performance tests. Flent provides various test methodologies, including those specifically designed to evaluate bufferbloat and network latency. For testing SQM, you may want to focus on latency tests to assess how effectively SQM manages traffic under different conditions.

Analyze Results: Once the tests are complete, analyze the results generated by Flent. Pay attention to metrics such as latency, jitter, and packet loss to evaluate the effectiveness of SQM in mitigating bufferbloat and improving overall network performance.

Iterate and Optimize: Based on the test results, make adjustments to your SQM configuration as needed to optimize network performance further. This may involve fine-tuning SQM parameters or experimenting with different queue disciplines and configurations.

Repeat Testing: Repeat the Flent tests periodically to monitor network performance over time and ensure that SQM continues to operate effectively as network conditions change.
