Certainly, here's a simplified breakdown of the steps involved in compiling a C program with the BHR toolchain, deploying it inside a "Hello World" container with the necessary libraries, and running it on a router, presented in bullet points:

Compile the C Program:

Use the BHR toolchain to compile the C program.
Ensure the binary is compatible with the target architecture of the router.
Prepare the HelloWorld Container:

Create a Dockerfile for the HelloWorld container.
Copy the compiled binary into the container image.
Include necessary dynamic libraries (*.so files) to resolve runtime dependencies.
Build the Container Image:

Use Docker or a compatible container tool to build the HelloWorld container image from the Dockerfile.
Transfer the Container Image to the Router:

Save the container image to a file (using docker save or equivalent).
Transfer the image file to the router (via SCP, FTP, or other file transfer methods).
Load the Container Image on the Router:

Use container management commands compatible with the router's OS to load the image file into the router's container runtime.
Run the Container:

Deploy and start the HelloWorld container on the router.
Ensure the container is correctly attached to the necessary network interfaces or configured to interact with the router's environment as needed.
Monitor and Validate:

Monitor the container's logs and the router's status to ensure the C program is running as expected.
Validate the program's functionality and performance within the containerized environment.
Troubleshooting:

Identify any issues encountered during deployment or execution.
Apply necessary fixes to the container configuration, program code, or runtime environment.
Documentation:

Document the process, including the compilation commands, Dockerfile contents, and deployment steps.
Note any specific configurations or dependencies crucial for the program's successful execution.
