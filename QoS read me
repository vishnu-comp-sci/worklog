Objective: Evaluate the effectiveness of device prioritization in the current network setup, focusing on Quality of Service (QoS) for video conferencing.

Key Focus: Analyze and optimize QoS configurations to minimize latency in video conferencing, ensuring high-quality, seamless communication.

Data Collection: Gather and analyze data using latency as a key performance indicator in video conferencing scenarios.

Analysis: Examine the impact of current QoS settings on video conferencing performance, identifying bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

Optimization Recommendations: Develop actionable recommendations for enhancing QoS settings to prioritize video conferencing traffic, reduce jitter and latency.

Goal: Achieve optimized network performance for robust and interruption-free video conferencing across the organization.
